- What is a version control system?
- How can a version control system help make my work reproducible?
- What does a standard version control workflow look like?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives
After completing this episode, participants should be able to:

- Create self-contained commits using Git to incrementally save work
- Inspect logs to review the history of work
- Push new work from a local machine to a remote server

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this episode, we'll cover the basics of version control, and explore
how it can help us produce reproducible and sustainable scientific projects.
We'll create a new software project from our existing code, make some changes to it (tracking them with version control), and then store those changes remotely - both for safe-keeping, and to make them easier to share.

At this point, the downloaded code to start working with in this episode should be as in:

## What is a version control system?

Version control systems are tools that let you track changes in files over time, and use that information.
They keep track of every modification to the files in a special database that allows users to "travel through time",
and compare earlier versions of the files with the current state.
Think of a version control system like turning on 'Track Changes' on Microsoft Word/Google Docs,
but for *any* files you want, and a lot more powerful and flexible.

### Why use a version control system?

As scientists, our main motivation for using version control is **reproducibility**.
By tracking and storing every change we make,
we can restore our project to the state it was at any point in time.
This is incredibly useful for reproducing results from a specific version of the code,
or tracking down which changes we (or others!) made introduced bugs or changed our results.

The other benefit of version control is it provides us with a *history* of our development.
As we make each change, we record what it was, and why we made it.
This helps make our development process transparent, and auditable -- good scientific practice.

Later on in the course, we'll also see how version control makes it easier for multiple collaborators to work together on the same project, and easily combine their contributions.

## Git version control system

**Git** is the most popular version control system, and the one we'll be using.
It's used mostly for managing code when developing software, but it can track *any* files - and it's particularly effective with text-based files (e.g. source code like `.py`, `.c`, `.r`, but also `.csv`, `.tex` and more).

Git stores files in **repositories**; directories where changes to the files can be tracked.
The diagram below shows the different parts of a repository,
and the most common commands used to work with one.
We'll cover these commands in more detail -- this is just a high-level overview.

![Software development lifecycle with Git](episodes/fig/ep03_fig05-git-lifecycle.svg){alt='Software development lifecycle with Git showing Git commands and flow of data between components of a Git system, including working directory, staging area, local and remote repository'}

- **Working directory** - a local directory (including any subdirectories) where your project files live,
  and where you are currently working.
  It's also known as the “untracked” area of Git.
  Any changes to files will be marked by Git in the working directory.
  Git will only *save* changes that you explicitly tell it to.
  Using `git add FILENAME` command, can you tell Git to start tracking changes to file `FILENAME` in your working directory.
- **Staging area (index)** - once you tell Git to start tracking changes to files (with `git add FILENAME` command),
  Git saves those changes in the staging area on your local machine.
  Each subsequent change to the same file needs to be followed by another `git add FILENAME` command to tell Git to update it in the staging area.
  To see what's in your working directory and staging area at any moment (i.e. what changes is Git tracking),
  you can run the command `git status`.
  The staging area lets you bundle together groups of changes to save to your repository.
- **Local repository** - stored within the `.git` directory of your project locally,
  this is where Git wraps together all your changes from the staging area and puts them using the `git commit` command.
  Each commit is a new, permanent snapshot (checkpoint, record) of your project in time, which you can share or revert to.
- **Remote repository** - this is a version of your project that is hosted somewhere on the Internet (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab or somewhere else).
  While your project is nicely version-controlled in your local repository, and you have snapshots of its versions from the past,
  if your machine crashes - you still may lose all your work.
  Plus, you can't share or collaborate on local work with others easily (other than by emailing back and forth).
  Working with a remote repository involves 'pushing' your local changes to it (using `git push`),
  and pulling other people’s changes back to your local copy (using `git fetch` or `git pull`).
  This keeps the two in sync in order to collaborate, with a bonus that your work also gets backed up to another machine.
  Best practice when collaborating with others on a shared repository is to always do a `git pull` before a `git push`,
  to ensure you have any latest changes before you push your own.

Git is a distributed version control system allowing for multiple people to be working on the same project
(even the same file) at the same time.
Initially, we will use Git to start tracking changes to files on our local machines; later on we will start sharing our
work on GitHub allowing other people to see and contribute to our work.


### Create a new repository

We'll demo Git using the command line, so open VS Code and start a new terminal via **Terminal -> New Terminal**.

::: instructor

Open up VS Code, and launch a **Git Bash** terminal.
Call out how your prompt looks, and make sure that Windows users aren't accidentally using PowerShell.
[Refer back to the setup section on configuring VS Code if anyone hasn't got it right.](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-research-software/instructor/installation-instructions.html#visual-studio-code)

:::

Before we start, if you didn't do it during setup, tell Git to use `main` as the default branch.
More modern versions of Git use `main`, but older ones still use `master`.
They work the same, but we want to keep things consistent for clarity.

```bash
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

We'll start by creating a new empty folder on our desktop, called `spacewalks`, and moving to it:

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir spacewalks
$ cd spacewalks
```

Then, we tell Git to make `spacewalks` a repository -- a directory where Git can track changes to our files:

```bash
$ git init
```

We can check everything is set up correctly by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

The exact wording of this output may be slightly different if you are using a different version of Git.

Now, we'll open the directory in VS Code -- go to **File -> Open Folder** and find **Desktop / spacewalks**.
You might need to open a new terminal afterwards!


### Add initial files into our repository

As part of [our setup](./index.html#astronaut-data-and-analysis-code), we downloaded `astronaut-data-not-so-fair.zip`.
This contained, among other things, two files we'll be using for this episode:

- `my code v2.py`
- `data.json`

We want to move these files into the folder we just set up.
You can either drag and drop the files from a file explorer window into the left pane of the VS Code,
or you can use the [`mv` command](https://linuxcommandlibrary.com/man/mv) in the command line terminal.

```bash
mv /path/where/you/saved/the/file/my\ code\ v2.py ~/Desktop/spacewalks/
mv /path/where/you/saved/the/file/data.json ~/Desktop/spacewalks/
```

Let's see what that's done to our repository by running `git status` again:

```bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	data.json
	my code v2.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

This tells us that Git has noticed the new files, but unlike something like Dropbox or OneDrive, it doesn't *automatically* track them.
Helpful, given scientific code can have vast inputs or outputs we might not want to store (e.g. 10s of GB of space telescope data),
or require sensitive information we can't share (e.g. medical records).

We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

```bash
$ git add my\ code\ v2.py
$ git add data.json
```

and then check the right thing happened:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   data.json
	new file:   my code v2.py
```

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `my code v2.py` and `data.json`, but it hasn't 'committed' those changes to the record yet.
A commit is a snapshot of how your tracked files have changed at a stage in time.
To create one a commit, and record that we've added two new files, we need to run one more command:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add an example script and dataset to work on"
```

```output
[main (root-commit) bf55eb7] Add and example script and dataset to work on
 2 files changed, 437 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 data.json
 create mode 100644 my code v2.py
```

Now, Git has taken everything we have told it to save by using `git add` and stored a copy in a special, hidden `.git` directory.
This is called a commit (or revision).

The `-m` option means message, and records a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why.
If we run `git commit` *without* `-m` , Git will still expect a message - and will launch a text editor so that we can write a longer one.

Good commit messages start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit.
Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will...".
If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes.
Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now, we see:

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This tells us that everything is up to date.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Where are my changes?

If we run `ls` at this point, we'll still only see two files - our script, and our dataset.
That's because Git saves information about files' history in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier.
This both stops our folders being cluttered with old versions, and *also* stops us accidentally deleting them!

You can see the hidden Git directory using the `-a` flag to show all files and folders:

```bash
$ ls -a
```

```output
.
..
.git
```

If you delete it, your directory will stop being a repository, and you'll lose your history of changes.
You never need to look into `.git` yourself -- we'll go into how to look at the history of your changes later.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Make a change

Did you notice how when we were typing the Python script into the terminal, we had to add a slash before the space
like this: `my\ code\ v2.py`?
Using a backslash in this way is called 'escaping' and it lets the terminal know to treat the space
as part of the filename, and not a separate argument.
It's a bit inconvenient and can cause problems if you forget, so best practise is to avoid spaces in filenames.
We'll go ahead and replace the spaces with underscores `_` instead.
You can use the `mv` command to rename files:

```bash
$ mv my\ code\ v2.py my_code_v2.py
```

If you run `git status` again, you'll see Git has noticed the change in the filename.

```bash
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    my code v2.py

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	my_code_v2.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

:::  challenge

### Add and commit the changed file

Using the Git commands demonstrated so far, save the change you just made to the Python script.

Remember, commit messages should be descriptive and complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will...".
You can also use `git status` to check the status of your project at any time.

:::  solution

### Solution

To save the changes to the renamed Python file, use the following Git commands:

```bash
$ git add my\ code\ v2.py my_code_v2.py
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    my code v2.py -> my_code_v2.py
```

```bash
$ git commit -m "Replace spaces in Python filename with underscores"
```

```output
[main 8ea2a0b] Replace spaces in Python filename with underscores
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename my code v2.py => my_code_v2.py (100%)
```

### Advanced solution

We initially renamed the Python file using the `mv` command, and we than had to `git add` *both* `my_code_v2.py`
and `my\ code\ v2.py`.
Alternatively, we could've used Git's own `mv` command like so:

```bash
$ git mv my\ code\ v2.py my_code_v2.py
$ git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    my code v2.py -> my_code_v2.py
```

`git mv <old> <new>` is the equivalent of running `mv <old> <new>` immediately followed by `git add <new>`, so the changes have been staged automatically.
We just need to commit them.

```bash
$ git commit -m "Replace spaces in Python filename with underscores"
```

```output
[main 6499bd7] Replace spaces in Python filename with underscores
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename my code v2.py => my_code_v2.py (100%)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Rename our data and output files

Now that we've seen how to rename files in Git, let's:

(i) give our input data file and script more meaningful names and
(ii) choose informative file names for our output data file and plot.

First let's update file names in our script using VS Code.

```python
data_f = open('./eva-data.json', 'r')
data_t = open('./eva-data.csv','w')
g_file = './cumulative_eva_graph.png'
```

Now, let's actually rename our files on the file system using Git, and commit our changes.
```bash
git mv data.json eva-data.json
git mv my_code_v2.py eva_data_analysis.py
git add eva_data_analysis.py
git status
```
```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    data.json -> eva-data.json
	renamed:    my_code_v2.py -> eva_data_analysis.py
```

Finally, let's commit our changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Implement informative file names"
```


### Commit messages

We've already met the concept of commit messages in our first commit,
but we'll go into them in a bit more depth.
Commit messages are short descriptions of what a commit does, and why you did it.
It's important to make sure they're helpful and descriptive,
as when you or a collaborator look back at your code they provide vital context.
This can make tracking down specific changes in commits much easier,
compared to having to trawl through all the previous versions of your files to figure out what change altered your code's behaviour.

Generally, commit messages should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will...".
Usualy a short, 50 character (ish) summary is enough,
but if you'd like to give more detail you can leave a blank line then write a long-form description.
There's a range of conventions for commit messages,
that range from very structured (such as [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)) to the friendly (such as [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)).
The most important thing is that the message is clear to the reader.
If a project is using a specific commit message convention, this will usually be described in their
[contributing guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributing_guidelines).

   ```

:::  solution

### Solution

Commit message (2) is pretty clearly better, as it actually tells you what the author did.
If a section of your code that depended on this code broke after this change,
you could easily tell why, and how to fix it.
The message could be improved further by adding a blank line then some detail on *why* this change was made.
Not every change needs more than 50 characters,
but a few extra seconds of writing can save you hours of bug-hunting!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Self-contained commits

If we want our commit messages to be descriptive and helpful,
then we have to make very self-contained commits.
Each one should only change one logical thing, to completion -
 for example, adding documentation, or renaming a function.
We don't mean that changes are committed line-by-line!
This is partly why Git has the staging area,
rather than automatically saving changes file-by-file like Dropbox or OneDrive.
If a change requires modifying multiple files to make sense, like when we renamed the input data file,
then you can commit *all* the edits required for it in one go,
so you don't have logical inconsistencies in your code.

Equally, don't avoid committing code until it's *totally* finished.
Most changes can be broken down into smaller steps. which can be completed.
It's better to have part-finished code in a repository,
with clear commit messages saying what still needs doing,
than code that never gets committed and can be lost in a hard drive crash!

See the ["Things to avoid when creating commits" section][git-commit-avoid]
of [Openstack's "Git Commit Good Practice" documentation][git-commit-good-practice] for examples of logical,
self-contained commits, and commits that don't follow this practice.

Self-contained commits are important as:
* Reviewing changes is easier when each commit tackles one step
* Tracking down changes that broke functionality is simpler
* Unwanted changes can be undone in small increments, without losing a lot of unrelated work.

from the [Software Carpentry Version control with Git lesson][swc-git-lesson].

:::  solution

### Solution

The git `diff` presented in option (1) is cleaner. The author has only tackled
one thing: placing the import statements at the top of the file.
This kind of commit is much easier to review in isolation, and will be easier to track down
if [`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) is required.

### Git logs

If we want to know what we've done recently, we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

```bash
$ git log
```

```output
commit 6499bd731ab50fde2731ce2642f143cea86450b6 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Sarah Gibson <drsarahlgibson@gmail.com>

commit bf55eb7639a6508658aaa1bfeaeb9f115d1bcc40
Author: Sarah Gibson <drsarahlgibson@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jun 17 11:52:02 2024 +0100

    Add and example script and dataset to work on
```

This output demonstrates why it's important to write meaningful and descriptive commit messages.
Without them, we'd only have the commit hashes (the strings of letters and numbers after "commit") to identify each one,
which is realistically impossible.

We might need to inspect our recent commits to establish where a bug was introduced,
or because we've realised we made a mistake and want to go back to an older, working version of the code.
Once we've identified the last commit we want to keep,
we can revert the state of our project back to that commit with a few different methods:

- [`git revert`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert):
  This command reverts a commit by creating a new commit that undoes the changes in the supplied commit (or list of commits).
  Because this command creates new commits, your history is more complete,
  and tells the story of exactly what work you did, i.e., deciding to discard some work.
- [`git reset`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset):
  This command will recover the state of the project at the specified commit.
  What's done with the commits you had made since then is defined by some optional flags:
  - `--soft`: Changes you've made since then are kept, but left as "Changes to be committed".
  - `--mixed`: Changes you've made since then are kept, but not marked for commit (the default).
  - `--hard`: All changes you've made since that commit are thrown away.

Using `git reset` command produces a "cleaner" history, but doesn't tell the full story of your work.
Generally, you'll want to `git revert`, both to avoid accidentally deleting changes you wanted to keep,
and to keep a record of what you tried but wasn't successful.
A negative result is still a result, and if you forget what didn't work you're likely to repeat it.


## Interacting with a remote Git server

Git is also a distributed version control system, and lets us synchronise work between multiple copies of
the same repository - including ones that aren't on your machine (**'remote repositories'**).
So far, we've been working with a **local repository** on our machine and,
even though we have been incrementally saving our work in a way that is recoverable (version control),
if we lost our machine then we'd lose all our code along with it,

Fortunately, we can easily upload our **local repository**,
with all our code and the history of our devleopment,
to a remote server so that it can be recovered in future.

![Git - distributed version control system, image from W3Docs (freely available)](episodes/fig/git-distributed.png){alt='2 Git repositories belonging to 2 different developers linked to a central repository and one another showing two way flow of information in each link'}

[GitHub][github] is an online software development platform that can act as a central remote server.
It uses Git, and provides facilities for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
Other Git hosting services are available, such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).

Putting our projects on GitHub doesn't just make them accident-proof, but also makes it easy to collaborate and share them.
Our collaborators can access the project, download their own copy, and even contribute work back to us.

We'll now go through how to push a **local repository** to [GitHub](https://github.com) and share it publicly.

1. In your browser, navigate to <https://github.com> and sign into your account
2. In the top right hand corner of the screen, there is a menu labelled "+" with
   a dropdown. Click the dropdown and select "New repository" from the options.

   ![*Creating a new GitHub repository*](fig/ep03_fig01-create_new_repo.jpg){ alt-text="Selecting the 'New repository' option from GitHub's dropdown menu" .image-with-shadow }

3. You will be presented with some options to fill in or select while creating
   your repository. In the "Repository Name" field, type "spacewalks". This is
   the name of your project and matches the name of your local folder.

   ![*Naming the GitHub repository*](fig/ep03_fig02-repository_name.png){ alt-text="Setting the name of the repository on GitHub" .image-with-shadow }

   Ensure the visibility of the repository is "Public" and leave all other options
   blank. Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs
   to be empty which is why we don't initialise with a README or add a license or
   `.gitignore` file. Click "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.

   ![*Complete GitHub repository creation*](fig/ep03_fig03-create_repository.jpg){ alt-text="Completing the creation of the GitHub repository" .image-with-shadow }

4. Now you've created your **remote repository**, you need to send the files and the history
   you have stored on your local computer to GitHub's servers.
   GitHub provides some instructions on how to do that for different scenarios.
   Change the toggle on the right side from "HTTPS" to "SSH",
   then look at the heading "...or push an existing repository from the command line".
   You should see instructions will look like this:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE>/spacewalks.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

  **It's very important you make sure you've switched from "HTTPS" to "SSH".**
  In the setup, we configured our GitHub account and our local machine for SSH.
  If you select HTTPS, you won't be able to upload your files.

   You can copy these commands using the button that looks like two overlapping
   squares to the right-hand side of the commands. Paste them into your terminal
   and run them.

   ![*Copy the commands to sync the local and remote repositories*](fig/ep03_fig04-copy_commands.jpg){ alt-text="Copying the commands to sync the local and remote repositories" .image-with-shadow }

5. If you refresh your browser window, you should now see the two files `my-code-v2.py`
   and `eva-data.json` visible in
   the GitHub repository, matching what you have locally on your machine.

Let's explain a bit more about what those commands did...

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE>/spacewalks.git
```

This command tells Git to create a `remote` called "origin" and link it to the URL of your GitHub repository.
A `remote` is a version control concept where two (or more) repositories are connected to each other,
 in such a way that they can be kept in sync by exchanging commits.
"origin" is a name used to refer to the remote repository.
It could be called anything, but "origin" is a convention that
is often used by default in Git and GitHub since it indicates which repository
is considered the "source of truth", particularly useful when many people are
collaborating on the same repository.

```bash
git branch -M main
```

`git branch` is a command used to manage branches.
We'll discuss branches later on in the course.
This command ensures the branch we are working on is called "main".
This will be the default branch of the project for everyone working on it.

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

The `git push` command is used to update remote repositories with any changes you've made locally.
This command tells Git to update the "main" branch on the "origin" remote.
The `-u` flag (short for `--set-upstream`) sets the 'tracking reference' for the current branch,
so that in future `git push` will default to sending to `origin main`.

### Terminology

In pairs or small groups, discuss the difference between the terms `remote`
and `origin`. What is the definition of each term?

:::  solution

### Solution

- `remote`: a version control concept where two (or more) repositories are linked
  together in such a way that they can be kept in sync by exchanging commits
- `origin`: a common Git/GitHub naming convention for the remote repository to
  designate the source of truth for collaborators

### Summary

We've covered the basics of using version control to track changes to our projects.
We created a new project, and used it to log our changes as 'commits', with informative messages.
From this information we looked back at our work, compared different versions, and even recovered past states.
Finally, we published our work to remote servers, where it's both secure and shareable.

These skills are critical to reproducible and sustainable science.
Software *is* science, and being able to share the specific version of code used in a paper is required for reproducibility.
But we, as researchers, also benefit from having a clear, self-documented record of what we did, when and why.
It makes it much easier to track down and fix our bugs, or to return to projects we've taken a break from.

Version control's a vast topic and this brief introduction has only covered the absolute basics.
If you'd like a deeper and more complete dive into it, there's more in our **Further Reading** section.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Version control systems are software that tracks and manages changes to a project over time
- Using version control aids reproducibility since the exact state of the software that produced an output can be
recovered
- A commit represents the smallest unit of change to a project
- Commit messages describe what each commit contains and should be descriptive
- Logs can be used to overview the history of a project
